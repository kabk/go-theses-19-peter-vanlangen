From New York’s dance floors in the 70s to Georgian club Bassiani today, dance floors form community centres to resist oppression and violence. However, a large number of representations of underground club culture fails to show the meaningful aspect of <span data-w-id="013f2d76-8aef-534e-cc2d-6640a76fc227" class="glossary-span">hedonistic</span> raves. Dance floors that form platforms for progressive movements are victims of police raids. Places where people criticise society and promote alternative values and cultures, can be a political enemy. Therefore, the clubbing community needs to reclaim their spaces and fight for them. Understanding the value of these safer environments helps in this fight. Discussing the impact dance floors have on <span data-w-id="c0104c17-b861-cf55-5f7b-edc70bd0b9b0" class="glossary-span">marginalised</span> communities can influence like-minded people. The research argues that dance floors go beyond hedonistic playgrounds and function as platforms to resist oppression and violence the queer community faces. The argumentation is derived from interviews with key activists and artists for whom nightlife forms an essential role in their lives. The study introduces dance floors from the past that have been fundamental for queer underground nightlife. It focuses on the role Georgian Club Bassiani plays in an environment with a low acceptance towards the queer community. These results indicate that dance floors can go beyond hedonism and play a crucial roles in the lives of these people. On this basis, it is recommended for people active in underground club culture, to act responsible towards representations. This can be accomplished by taking a distance from the fashionable representations of queer communities. Further research could be undertaken to identify other factors that could help defending these safer environments. </div><div id="w-node-79129fe7ef19-af098194" class="chapter">1</div><div id="w-node-ee169997de9b-af098194" class="chapter">Introduction</div><div id="introduction" class="frame-chapters-menu w-node-3d01c8757c7d-af098194"></div><div id="w-node-919c9c0c3f76-af098194" class="text-block-copy">At an age of 18, I experienced a difficult coming out.

The commercialisation of dance music makes the influence of these people invisible. During my first nightlife experiences at, Amsterdam’s famous gay street Reguliersdwarsstraat, I lacked knowledge of queer communities and their influence on nightlife. This is a fragmented version of the history. Think of it as remembering the highlights of a sweaty club night.<br><br><strong>New York</strong><br>During New York&#x27;s 70s a large number of men expressed their gay identity through disco. Some experienced a trip of self-discovery on these dance floors. They discovered their same-sex partner preferences, while others already knew this. Mixed crowds of bisexual and straight men, lesbian women and straight admirers of gay men, joined them. A dance of new liberation under the guidance of disco’s soul/gospel inspired funky grooves. New York&#x27;s police persecuted people for being black, Latino and gay during this time. These people had no way to express themselves freely, without a heavy backlash from the authorities. Hooking up with another man was a high-risk affair.<span data-w-id="4d9ea3c0-8345-a2ef-be6e-4b425083c174" class="notes">[3]</span> In 1969, the Los Angeles Police Department made 3,858 arrests categorised under crime used to prosecute gays.<span data-w-id="6f5d931e-432a-a0f9-d88e-56a4275f0994" class="notes">[4]</span> Only when the police came, the dancing abruptly stopped. Clubs and DJs from this period are fundamental for gay culture and the creation of club culture as we experience it today. Before introducing these clubs a step back to the Stonewall Riots and the Continental Baths is necessary.<br>‍<br>Violent riots between police and bar patrons erupted on the evening of June 28, 1969. The police raids on New York&#x27;s Stonewall Inn gay bar triggered the riots. Raids of homosexual bars were common in New York and other American cities during the 60s. Instead of accepting humiliating treatment, the bar patrons fought back this time. Although Stonewall did not mark the origin of gay liberation, it played a tremendous role in gay culture and nightlife.<span data-w-id="066ffe37-a07d-b26b-0cea-0fed44c791c7" class="notes">[5]</span> Stonewall&#x27;s protests changed the face of nightlife and triggered gay liberation on the dance floor, all the great clubs that followed could focus on gay crowds and let guys dance together. The event did not change the freedom of these community drastically in public yet. The liberation shifted towards underground nightlife.<span data-w-id="bac458c6-dbd9-8e46-24dc-7f218d6cec3b" class="notes">[6]</span><br>‍<br>One year earlier, in 1968, Steve Osrow founded The Continental Baths, a gay bathhouse in New York. It acted both as a hedonistic playground and a community centre for the queer community. The police raided the bathhouse over two hundred times. Continental Baths collected over 250,00 signatures for a petition to change New York City’s outdated laws. The petition resulted in the repeal of laws against homosexuality in New York and marked a victory in gay liberation. Two gay African-American men, Frankie Knuckles and Larry Levan first visited the club in 1973 and developed their DJ skills here.<span data-w-id="2675184a-8c0a-55bc-3b37-11cbefd1f230" class="notes">[7]</span><br><br>Shortly after the Stonewall riots David Mancuso held his first private house parties at his loft in 1970. The Loft was one of the first dance floors where gay men could safely come together in a racially, economically and sexually mixed crowd. David’s vision was to offer his guests a way to break free from the violence and oppression of reality.<span data-w-id="1fb92ea1-376f-b758-998d-738547814f07" class="notes">[8]</span> Dancers partied under sound vibrations from one of the best sound systems. David fine-tuned the sound system throughout the night. The place was not stated as an official club, for example, alcohol was not being sold. Therefore, closing times did not exist, and parties stretched at least from midnight until afternoon. The Loft became an influential example for all the clubs that followed.<span data-w-id="4011107d-b444-43db-c306-cd83e83b81a5" class="notes">[9]</span> Around the same time, entrepreneurs Seymour and Shelley took over the discotheque called ‘The Sanctuary’.

According to Mancuso, no other place came as close to the Loft. People began their weekends at the Gallery and ended them at the Loft. The ones who did not get into the Loft went to the Gallery.<span data-w-id="1df4b9a8-3e8b-fc9e-f965-e4cbb4abda47" class="notes">[11]</span> Around 1977, Both Larry Levan’s and Frankie Knuckles’ popularity exploded during their DJ residencies at the Gallery. Before, they both worked at the club. Knuckles DJ career took bigger steps when he became a resident DJ at Paradise Garage. A new club between 1977 and 1987 in an underground garage. Together with a massive devoted following of black and Latino members of the queer community, Paradise Garage influenced dance music and culture. The influence spread both nationally and internationally.

Which, resulted in an impoverished inner-city and an abandoned downtown. Under those circumstances racial and social tensions increased. Motown Records move to Los Angeles in 1972 marked the city’s cultural decline.<span data-w-id="2fd5ada9-cd29-c68a-81d3-1c17ae0c15b6" class="notes">[21]</span> The label was fundamental for Detroit’s African American music. Techno music played an tremendously role in putting Detroit back on the map.<br>‍<br>However, before the rise of techno in the mid-‘80s, a influential diverse musical period was taking place. Around 1980, Detroit’s dance crowds became more mixed on a social, racial and sexual level. One of the most respected people in the local music scene was Ken Collier, one of Detroit’s foremost queer disco DJs. Respected by many people outside of Detroit; in New York and Chicago. Collier did a long residency at the influential club Heaven.<span data-w-id="a2c35931-8d4d-660d-0f3a-8d31fcdd821b" class="notes">[22]</span> Mike Servito describes Club Heaven as “Music greatness. Ken Collier was Heaven. I feel very fortunate to have experienced such an iconic DJ. A community from the thriving music scene surrounded you at Club Heaven.”<span data-w-id="25e2c7cd-240e-0c05-1c24-727049ca6a53" class="notes">[23]</span><br>‍<br>Juan Atkins one of the founders of African American techno music was greatly influenced by DJ Ken Collier. Atkins and Vietnam veteran Rick Davis formed the electronic band Cybotron in the early 80s. With synthesiser and rhythm machine-based electronic music, they developed a philosophy that explored the utopian/dystopian contradiction of science fiction. The band inspired the younger Belleville high school friends, Derrick May and Kevin Saunderson.<span data-w-id="32b94605-5b84-8bae-f75f-b8983ef8fb0b" class="notes">[24]</span> The three individuals from the Detroit suburb known as the Belleville Three are credited for the birth of Detroit techno.<br>‍<br>In Germany techno became the sound of celebration when the Berlin wall collapsed in November 1989. Club Tresor located in abandoned vaults brought kids from East and West together. By the early 90s, Tresor’s founder Dimitri Hegemann formed a strong Berlin-Detroit connection. Bookings and releases on Tressor lifted many of Detroit’s artists their careers.<span data-w-id="2c4f2b96-cf16-a616-ccc0-2884a23c68b6" class="notes">[25]</span><br><br>In contrast the early 90s second-wave of techno manifested into a more aggressive and political charged sound. Together with Jeff Mills, Mike Banks started the independent record label and music group Underground Resistance.<span data-w-id="eb9744c3-e2d1-c263-3ae1-7327e0e9d6ce" class="notes">[26]</span> Mills was already known as local radioDJ ‘The Wizzard’ and Banks as part of house music band Members of the House.

James Stinson and Geral Donald created a retrofuturist mythology drawn from the history of the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade. Drexciya confronts the legacy of slavery and its present-day appearance in post-industrial America through music, visuals and texts.<span data-w-id="1cfdc682-a4a7-ea56-5647-5cbadc9db99b" class="notes">[28]</span><br>‍<br>For Mike Servito underground parties in the early 90s were places to meet like-minded open people and other gays, rather than gay bars and clubs. This is were Servito’s friendships with Jason Kending, Jeffrey Sfire and Carlos Souffront started over 20 years ago, and still continue. They represent a group of influential gay DJs from Detroit. “The early 90s in Detroit felt like a community that was very open to all walks of life”.<span class="notes">[29]</span></div><div id="w-node-aaeecfa7cf9a-af098194" data-w-id="557c7bab-ae33-6cff-7bc3-aaeecfa7cf9a" style="padding-top:56.17021276595745%" class="w-embed-youtubevideo youtube-3"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_BmXq39qmyY?rel=0&amp;controls=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;mute=1&amp;start=397" frameborder="0" style="position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:100%;height:100%;pointer-events:auto" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><div id="w-node-b2558fe1190a-af098194" data-w-id="f6245fb6-2b23-6005-2f02-b2558fe1190a" style="padding-top:56.17021276595745%" class="w-embed-youtubevideo youtube-5 w-hidden-tiny"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gVZ1aPX5gro?rel=0&amp;controls=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;mute=1&amp;start=0" frameborder="0" style="position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:100%;height:100%;pointer-events:auto" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><div id="w-node-00e2f3d7dcce-af098194" data-w-id="31d22010-b4a7-69a4-4853-00e2f3d7dcce" style="opacity:0" class="notes note21 w-hidden-tiny">21 Christoph Schaub, “Beyond the Hood?

Today, club Bassiani forms the centre for queer communities in Georgia.<br>‍<br>The low acceptance towards the queer community in Georgia expresses the role club Bassiani plays in the lives of these people. Onnik Krikorian writes how, on the 17th of May in 2013, 20,000 counter-demonstrators brutally disrupted the International Day Against Homophobia in Tbilisi. Despite a statement by Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili that lesbians and gays have the same right as any other social group. Patriarch Ilia II, the spiritual leader of the Georgian Orthodox Church, called for a band of the event and describes homosexuality as an abnormality and a disease. A small group of fifty queer activists had to flee the scene after counter-protestors broke through barriers.<span data-w-id="e80aa6f6-a00f-2c17-3f0c-d1032ead88ab" class="notes">[30]</span> This event demonstrated how queer people in Tbilisi have no ways to express themselves freely. This event triggered Tato Getia, Zviad Gelbakhiani and Naja Orashvili to start club Bassiani. They established a new place for resistance.<br>‍<br>Giorgi Kikonishvili is one of Georgia’s first outspoken queer activists and the organiser of the Horoom Nights queer parties in Bassiani. During an interview, Kikonishvili described the club space and why the atmosphere is so memorable. The club space is enormous and has the highest quality sound and light system. Bassiani’s main dance floor was a swimming pool in the past, underneath the Dinamo Arena football stadium in the heart of Tbilisi. Here Kikonishvili went from swimming as a child, to organising Horoom Nights.<span data-w-id="64f7052b-7dcd-e1d7-926d-2c536e50f2fb" class="notes">[31]</span> The name Horoom comes from a celebrated Georgian war dance, the Khorumi. The dance has been created to remind the Georgian nation that to maintain peace one must be prepared for war.<span data-w-id="98afac74-aa61-b82c-c484-d54a7e3746a5" class="notes">[32]</span> That is exactly what the Horoom Nights are about. <br>‍<br>Similarly as New York’s disco, Chicago’s house and Detroit’s techno, the struggles of reality trigger the liberating atmosphere on the dance floor. Kikonishvili explained how his country’s problems, like the oppression and violence towards the queer community and Georgia’s surreal drug policy, makes the crowd put all its emotions in it. You can feel this on the dance floor, the DJs feel it as well. If you have one pill in your possession, you risk a prison time of 5 to 8 years. This means you see friends disappear behind bars. “When you live in a country like this, and when you go to a party, it almost feels like your last party. When you come outside, you never know what will happen to you. Everything in Georgia is unexpected, so you always put all your emotions into it. It feels like your last dance”.<span data-w-id="d85d04b8-9dea-2608-bcd1-44c1f05c1632" class="notes">[33]</span> It is like two parallel realities, the difference between daily life and nightlife is immense. One reality creates opportunities to resist in a non-verbal way against the other.<br><br>Evidently we can trace back a long history of supportive clubs towards marginalised groups. Paata Sabelashvili, founder of Georgia’s first ever LGBTQ+ organisation and a member of the White Noise Movement, explained how the clubbing community in Tbilisi was already supportive towards the queer community. Although none of them is queer themselves, the club owners understood what was needed and missing on the dance floors. Something that lacked was women on the dance floor. Naja Orashvili, one of Bassiani’s founders was fighting for space for women in clubs. By talking to the few women in these spaces, problems came to light. Harassments in clubs made woman tired. All this knowledge, sympathy and commitment makes you feel at home. At club Bassiani you will see a gay couple making out, and a masculine macho guy dancing next to them, without anyone bothering each other. “What Bassiani made possible for some people to see, feel and go through, was a game changer. It changed expectations, future outlook and the mindset of an entire generation”.<span data-w-id="ee071d3c-51cb-6e8c-93dd-aeddab015116" class="notes">[34]</span> Giorgi explains how the first time he stepped into Club Bassiani it took him only ten minutes to realise this space will change a lot. “It felt like a different world. Bassiani was the first place where I kissed my boyfriend publicly feeling no fear at all. It changed my whole life. If there was no Bassiani in Georgia, what would we have? I do not want to imagine.”<span data-w-id="1f707687-de3b-7569-d666-881bf7e113a9" class="notes">[35]</span><br></div><div id="w-node-cc060703ae6d-af098194" data-w-id="67b5c3f1-8534-396d-71ee-cc060703ae6d" style="opacity:0" class="notes note30 w-hidden-tiny">30 Onnik Krikorian, “Orthodox Church goes on the rampage in Georgia, New Internationalist,<br>July 1, 2013, https://newint.org/sections/agenda/2013/07/01/georgia-church-lgbt.</div><div id="w-node-ed1515bc6975-af098194" data-w-id="cb5259c7-0e38-be30-ef4f-ed1515bc6975" style="opacity:0" class="notes note31 w-hidden-tiny">31 Giorgi Kikonishvili, interview with author, November 10, 2018.</div><div id="w-node-633773fb727b-af098194" data-w-id="0f664b52-9423-b5d2-d8ad-633773fb727b" style="opacity:0" class="notes note32 w-hidden-tiny">32 “Khorumi-Georgia,” <em>Dance Ask</em>, accessed November 26, 2018, danceask.com/khorumi-georgia/.</div><div id="w-node-f96fbbb7ae41-af098194" data-w-id="cbbb7fba-ccd8-2bb0-e7fc-f96fbbb7ae41" style="opacity:0" class="notes note33 w-hidden-tiny">33 Giorgi Kikonishvili, interview with author, November 10, 2018.</div><div id="w-node-ac673064b16d-af098194" data-w-id="ca8091f9-97f3-e559-33fa-ac673064b16d" style="opacity:0" class="notes note34 w-hidden-tiny">34 Paata Sabelashvili, Skype interview with author, December 3, 2018.</div><div id="w-node-8d28971f3fea-af098194" data-w-id="d111edb5-0ac8-9c98-0f96-8d28971f3fea" style="opacity:0" class="notes note35 w-hidden-tiny">35 Giorgi Kikonishvili, interview with author, November 10, 2018.</div><div id="w-node-267e01320f14-af098194" data-w-id="bc5d48ef-4d77-ff01-18f3-267e01320f14" style="opacity:0;padding-top:56.17021276595745%" class="w-embed-youtubevideo youtube-3 w-hidden-tiny"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0NErcgqgYeE?rel=0&amp;controls=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;mute=1&amp;start=0" frameborder="0" style="position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:100%;height:100%;pointer-events:auto" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><div id="safer-spaces" class="text-block-copy w-node-0f90ba6ed62f-af098194"><strong>Safer Spaces</strong><br>Clubs like the Loft and Paradise Garage are examples that demonstrated how important it is for marginalised people to enter a safer space than the world outside. Bassiani’s team understands how to achieve this. Luis-Manuel Garcia explained what elements create a safer space. Luis is an ethnomusicologist. He was a raver first, became a scholar in dance music and became involved in the Berlin-based Room 4 Resistance collective. According to Luis, creating ‘safer spaces’ has to do with outlining clearly what the expectations of behaviour are. Together with clear procedures for the organisation when problems arise, and feedback and complaints throughout the night. The actual physical space is also of importance. Without surveillance and being intrusive you want to keep an eye on how the night is going. These communities easily experience the feeling of being watched.<span data-w-id="461b2f99-262e-fa30-a1bd-67dddcbfd032" class="notes">[36]</span><br>‍<br>While being gay in Georgia often means nobody knows who you truly are, not your family neither your friends. Club Bassiani assures a place where you are free to express yourself and stop hiding your true self. Dark rooms form an important role in the Horoom Nights and provide a safe haven for visitors to meet and have sexual intercourse. The intercourse that happens here is a pure form of resisting the conservative values of the country. Kikonishvili explains that people who find it hard to express or identify their sexuality, can experience it in these spaces in privacy.<span data-w-id="8fccff86-569e-1952-0ecf-4116cf9be49f" class="notes">[37]</span><br>‍<br>One of Bassiani’s methods to assure a safer space, is the registration system of the club. For the registration a name, identity number and Facebook profile are needed. Verified users can skip the door control. Despite the exclusive members-only systems of the disco period, the role of Bassiani’ systems is to avert people that form a danger for other clubbers. Kikonishvili explains how the club implemented the registrations system at the start of Bassiani in 2014. Back then it was a completely different situation, it was even more important to have control. Nowadays the amount of control has changed. It is not an exclusive door policy at all. “We do not only want to dance with our friends, but with our former enemies”.<span data-w-id="4cab2f82-b4cb-86d4-37fd-cb2d22cd8108" class="notes">[38]</span><br>‍<br>Despite, the goal to create inclusive spaces, avoiding excluding people is impossible to assure safer spaces. During an interview, Garcia talked about the challenges of inclusivity when organising for a community that is usually not so welcomed and included. “With Room 4 Resistance we have been trying to develop a women-centric dark room for many parties. Because of how patriarchy works, its difficult to make that happen, without excluding cisgender men.<span data-w-id="36dbfc52-9444-d00f-9ba6-e858a952d682" class="notes">[39]</span><br><br><strong id="rave-revolution">Rave Revolution</strong><br>Spaces that provide a safer space like the Continental Baths and Stonewall Inn, also Bassiani and Café Gallery are unmistakably the victims of police raids. The police demonstrated an excessive use of authority towards harmless clubbers in May 2018. In the video of BBC News, hundreds of masked policemen, armed with machine-guns raided club Bassiani and Café Gallery. The police detained 70 people including one of the co-founders of Bassiani, Zviad Gelbakhiani, near the club. According to the government, it was part of a crackdown on drugs. In response, within hours, thousands of people had gathered on the square in front of Georgia’s parliament building to fight for freedom and equality.<span data-w-id="fcf78b44-a233-3d87-b06f-98573fcf66c1" class="notes">[40]</span> Kikonishvili points out that the main reason for the attack was an idealogical war. Bassiani was becoming strong enough for the government and conservative part of the country to become a headache. The progressive communities were speaking out the country’s and society’s problems. The government silenced the people, instead of solving any problems.<span data-w-id="4e052f90-d081-b3ba-b337-efbf951e0c49" class="notes">[41]</span><br>‍<br>Soon the protest turned into a two days rave for social change. DJs, from the label Giegling, started to play on a sound system that activists placed on the square. In the afternoon, more than 10,000 people had gathered. Sabelashvili explained how the organisers of a queer night shut down the club out of solidarity. Attendees in beautiful dresses and high heels went to the parliament to join the frontline of the protest. It was like a flashback of the Stonewall riots.<span data-w-id="1d41f4d5-84f4-7e57-c017-8e0fb92617cb" class="notes">[42]</span> During an interview, artist and researcher on club culture Bogomir Doringer draws the parallel between the protest of 2018 in Georgia and the story of the book <em>Time to Dance, a Time to Die</em>. In this story, the people entered an euphoric collective state of trance and danced for days. It was a dancing plague in 1518. They danced without an end in sight, until the government recognised the oppressive and unequal circumstances they lived under. This is when the dance stopped.”<span data-w-id="69117a80-2928-c060-ed10-82e622cca7d8" class="notes">[43]</span> Despite the nonviolent resistance from the protestors, the atmosphere changed when far-right groups turned up in force. In the video of BBC News, we can hear George Chelidze, the leader of the fascist group Georgian National Unity, saying the protest was offensive because it was leftish provocation.<span data-w-id="f596f49a-5e59-1b0c-487b-0bc9515ea070" class="notes">[44]</span> The protest was not only about the police raid, the protestors demanded drug legalisation and queer propagandism.

In contrast, of seeing nightlife purely as escapism and hedonism. Making the connection between the worlds inside and outside the club keep yourself grounded instead of losing yourself. By doing this, you can bring valuable experiences back to the world outside. According to Luis-Manuel, a method that brings resisting oppression from the dance floors into our daily lives is, “by emphasising the continuities between the dance floor and daily life. And sometimes undermine and push against the idea of dance floors as an escape, or disconnected utopia.” Spaces serving a break from a certain oppression are important. They provide a staging ground for alternative ways of being together and communicating to carry out into the larger world. A track that connects to this idea is the intro of DJ Sprinkles album <em>Midtown 120 Blue</em>. The point she makes is people within queer subcultural communities face and that the dance floor works as a refuge, but we should not forget some of it follows us.<span data-w-id="7326f335-ab25-19d8-f4a3-9be7b028ba96" class="notes">[54]</span><br>‍<br>According to Sabelashvili It’s not about hedonism only. “We could use the dance as a common ground to unite people. This dance never radiates any violence to anyone. We should start a global movement and together protest against the crazy things that happen in the world. Not only for drug policies, queer equality and women’s rights.”<span data-w-id="858d864f-ba80-409a-b654-6fb55b87c2c8" class="notes">[55]</span> In an interview, Doringer explained how every dance is about something else. As a kid, he went to a techno club during the bombings in Belgrade. “When you are 16 and they tell you do not go to school and the bombings are happening and you know the techno club is open, well sure why not… You go there and it feels like mocking the political system and the dead. You think you are super cool, but at the same time, you realise that you are actually really scared. So you kind of just beat up this feeling and you dance like crazy.”<span data-w-id="e8f90a15-7e33-41bd-1fe0-248f46c75b70" class="notes">[56]</span> For Mike Servito being part of club culture gave him a sense of belonging. It made him realise that you can live in a way that does not coincide with societies expectations. “I learned the value of friendship and the value of self-worth. I think all my experiences in club culture has made me tougher and smarter and dealing with life&#x27;s obstacles. You learn a lot by being around so many characters in club culture.”<span data-w-id="3bfc6775-8781-bac0-8c8f-1ecee314d632" class="notes">[57]</span><br>‍<br>Often people forgot to see the values these places have for society and the country. A great example of a city that recognises the value of such a venue is Berlin. The German court has ruled club Berghain with a High Culture Status. This means the club provides high cultural events rather than just entertainment. The club will accordingly pay taxes at a lower rate, 7% tax instead of 19%.<span data-w-id="6e349153-8bb3-c8d8-f545-40aeac18e296" class="notes">[58]</span> It became clear during an interview with Doringer that it’s important to think about the direct economic values a place has. These places play an important role in putting a city or country on the map. Club Bassiani in Tbilisi is a great example of this. Doringer states that: “The reasons for this kind of places to exist is that cultural institutions failed to reunite different groups. The cultural institutions do not provide space for diversity, inclusivity, discussion and certain cultures so the club took this role. If you think of the number of people going to a place like Berghain compared to a gallery or museum it is incomparable, they circulate and directly influence and educate people.”<span data-w-id="bda30c5f-5f4e-cbce-f3f9-d7aa0dac5577" class="notes">[59]</span><br>‍<br>But why does dancing on these dance floors break down social barriers and create such a powerful bonding between strangers? An important element of dance floors collectiveness. According to Ricardo Villalobos, togetherness within crowds of people comes from the consistent, rhythmic music we all share.<span data-w-id="be0c7e37-9c5b-c356-3b66-0b33c7e1a495" class="notes">[60]</span>  The beat makes you connect in a non-verbal way with strangers. Together moving under the guidance of these sound vibrations make you connect easier with strangers. Smile to the person next to you, acknowledge that you are both in this journey is enough. Or follow the beat with the same body movements as the person in front of you. Like we all communicate under the same language. Sabelashvili describes the element of bonding as dancing to the person next to you makes this person your new family member. Sometimes people here take better care of you than your own family. After you danced with a person to the same music, the differences dissolve. “It competes with faith, family and conformity, it competes with everything. All that matters is this person dancing there with you, a common ground that unites you. Regardless of who you are you fight for the same principles. It makes you spiritually benefit from this ritual.”<span data-w-id="f8fd5f63-2681-a486-bb66-d6946e8eaac5" class="notes">[61]</span><br>‍<br>More than beats and dancing drive the atmosphere of dance floors. A combination of rhythm, sound and lights are according to Beatrice Aarson the right conditions to enhance togetherness and break down classifications such as race, religion and gender. The rhythmic bombardment of drums and the movement from the dance bring our body and mind in a different state of consciousness. A state that breaks down all concepts of class.<span data-w-id="57d9036f-1536-9fdc-c5cc-5791bd623967" class="notes">[62]</span> Similarities between raves and trance dances of the Dobe Ju/‘hoansi of Botswana can be drawn. No mind-altering substances are involved in these trance dances. A trance state is reached by a combination of the rhythmic drumming of the Ju/‘hoansi, which is like the drumbeat-drive pulse of techno, exhaustive all-night dancing and flickering lights.<span data-w-id="6357918b-e0e1-b1d2-58fb-bf5933f73775" class="notes">[63]</span> Raving is a modern version of trance dances.<br>‍<br>Looking back at my difficult coming out where I rather adjusted to my heteronormative surroundings, I can tell that it highly influences your psychic well-being. Being unable and not wanting to reveal your true self is hard. It made me deal with uncertainty, anxiety and stress, I realised this could have to do with hiding my sexuality. Covering your true self and being someone else is exhausting. According to Landy’s role theory a variety of mental, social and functional roles, are making up our personalities. Switching between roles provides us with a range of choices and reduces the anxiety that comes with attaching oneself to a single identity. This role-play explains the Dionysian atmosphere of a queer party. At queer parties, you can step into a different role and identity. And for a moment celebrate total freedom. It allows muscular homos, femme lesbians, bisexuals and transgender men and woman to dance together without threatening each other’s identities.<span data-w-id="40bafc1b-35d1-27de-e2a4-014ba0913c7c" class="notes">[64]</span> An interesting parallel can be drawn to the ancient Greek god Dionysus. Dionysus was the god of intoxication, ecstasy and theatre. His followers called maenads, from the Greek word mania, “madness”. He represents the transgressor of borders. No distinction between sexes was made by Dionysus, he appears both as man and woman He was a god of chaos and the protector of misfits.<span data-w-id="e2c81aa9-89a2-89a8-8714-c9714fcbc88f" class="notes">[65]</span> Personally, I constantly had the feeling that playing in a metal band means having to live the expeditions that come with it. My role was being a tough heterosexual guy playing guitar in a metal band.<br>‍<br>Similar to dance floors of the 70s like The Loft and Paradise Garage, Bassiani forms the centre of queer communities. A place that activates activism and works towards social change. Here club nights about more than sex, drugs and escapism. It is about change even if it is for one night. A place where people experience recognition and total freedom of expression.</div><div id="w-node-7c5af671045c-af098194" data-w-id="dbe64a2f-ae25-53ed-cdfa-7c5af671045c" style="opacity:0" class="notes note60 w-hidden-tiny">60 <em class="w-hidden-tiny">Denk ich an Deutschland in der Nacht.</em> Directed by Romuald Karmakar.

During this time the police persecuted people for being black, Latino and gay in New York. Dancing under disco’s funky grooves was a way to break free from violence and oppression.<br>‍<br>Interviews with key activists from Tbilisi, Georgia show that the dance floor is still a place to break free from oppression and violence. The acceptance towards members of the queer community in Georgia is low. Club Bassiani forms the community centre for these people. On May 2018 various movements joined forces in Tbilisi, after police raids on multiple clubs. A rave for social change erupted. It was a flashback of New York&#x27;s Stonewall riots.<br>‍<br>The protest in Georgia demonstrates how the dance floor utopia of a world full of acceptance connects with the real world. Providing space for diversity, inclusivity and discussion are roles that the nightclub took. These safer environments are places to tryout alternative ways of communicating and living. Dancing on these dance floors breaks down social borders as race, religion, gender and sexuality. A rhythmic bombardment of drums, all night dancing and flickering lights bring the body and mind in a different state of consciousness.<br>‍<br>Although these spaces change marginalised people&#x27;s lives positively, 70&#x27;s police raids on clubs repeat itself in Tbilisi in 2018. Silencing progressive movements is easier for the government than solving problems. Platforms, where people can criticise society and promote alternative values, can be a political enemy.<br>‍<br>Dance floors go beyond hedonistic playgrounds. They form the centre of queer communities that experience oppression and violence. A platform for social change where different progressive movements meet.<br>The starting point of the research was based on how I experienced dance floors in The Netherlands and how they helped me with my sexuality. Being afraid and unsure to reveal who I am, made me deal with uncertainty, stress and anxiety. These safer environments were the most important places for my coming out.<br>‍<br>The research learnt me how I used role-play when I was uncertain of my sexuality. At a queer party you can step into a different role and identity. The dance floor was like a tryout stage. This role-play helped me with defining who I want to become and made me proud of who I am. The interviews show how close my experiences are to that of others. How music forms the common ground to fight for the same principles.<br>‍<br>Discussing the impact dance floors had on marginalised communities can influence like-minded people. It shows a community and environment that welcomes them. The study&#x27;s results show people inside and outside the community the value and urgency of spaces where oppressed people can feel safer. Making the potential of dance floors visible can educate recent clubbers.<br>‍<br>Often people portray underground club culture as a style or fashion which, results in dull and meaningless representations. Portrayed styles and fashions might attract young people but fail to show the meaningful face that hides beyond hedonistic raves. The interviewees are all people that danced out of urgency of which nightlife forms an essential role in their lives. These real stories show the value of these safer environments.</div><div id="w-node-4bf90937aa2b-af098194" style="padding-top:56.17021276595745%" class="w-embed-youtubevideo youtube-6"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Op8nlXFOPuc?rel=0&amp;controls=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;mute=0&amp;start=0" frameborder="0" style="position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:100%;height:100%;pointer-events:auto" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><div id="w-node-0593a78a123a-af098194" class="text-block-copy">The protests were led by the White Noise Movement which, advocates drug decriminalisation since 2013.

This stigma of going to jail for weed use made him feel ashamed “The reaction I encountered from educated and open-minded people around me, shocked me. I had hard times going through that period.

It demonstrates that club culture is more than partying. These communities are built from smart, educated people that think about the political systems they live in Many political ideas and struggles within society get shared and started on these dance floors and continue outside the club. According to Kikonishvili this protest was a manifestation of what we have achieved before. On this demonstration, we united all our progressive movement which used Bassiania as their platform. 5 years ago you could not gather 15.000 people who would defend these values.
