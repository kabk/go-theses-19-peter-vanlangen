    <div id="w-node-0802202b2a6c-e24ba3d1" class="text-block-copy">This thesis project is a study on the socio-political aspects of queer dance floors. It focuses on how music and dance floors play a role in resisting oppression and violence which, members of the queer community experience. The study briefly introduces historical queer orientated dance floors that have been fundamental for what we now know as underground nightlife. It focuses on a more recent emerging scene in Tbilisi, Georgia, where members of the queer community are less accepted. Interesting connections illustrate that safer spaces are still urgent for marginalised people. The results derive from personal interviews with key activists, artists and promoters of emerging scenes, combined with literature.</div>

    <div id="w-node-919c9c0c3f76-e24ba3d1" class="text-block-copy">At an age of 18, coming out of the closet was not easy for me. During my youth, I constantly felt the need to live up the expectations of my heteronormative surrounding. From playing in metal bands as well as in my family this seemed the norm. It was not until I danced on dance floors of certain clubs, that I started to accept myself and went on a self-discovery. These places showed me acceptance and a life behind the norms I grew up with. This experience brought me tot the study of dance floors as a platform to resist oppression and violence.<br>‍<br>The aim of the research is to demonstrate the importance of these places for members of the queer community. It presents the urgency, value and effect of safer spaces. The interest in the sociopolitical aspect of dance floors and it&#x27;s positive impact on society, increased in recent years.<br><br>Members of the queer community continue to face violence and inequality. In some parts of the world even torture and execution. This has a high psychological and social impact on these people. A safer environment is needed where they can break free from violence and oppression. A place to form a resistance and have absolute freedom of expression.<br><br>Research question:<br>How can historical underground queer orientated dance floors, and a more recent emerging scene in Georgia, show us that dance floors are fundamental for resisting oppression and violence?</div>

    <div id="w-node-206846055cd4-e24ba3d1" class="text-block-copy">It is important to trace back the origin of dance music and the marginalised black and Latino queer communities it is born in. Often listeners and dancers are not aware of it’s origin. It is necessary to respect the communities who started this. The commercialisation of dance scenes make these people more and more invisible.<br><br>During my first experience with night clubs at the Reguliersdwarsstraat, Amsterdam’s famous gay street, I lacked knowledge about the influence queer communities had on nightlife. This is fragmented version of the history. Think of it as remembering only the highlights of a sweaty night out.<br></div>

    <div id="w-node-e48f7e4c8f0e-e24ba3d1" class="text-block-copy">Violent riots between police and bar patrons erupted on the evening of June 28, 1969. Triggered by the police raids on the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in Greenwich Village, New York City. Raids of homosexual bars happened often in New York and other American cities during the 1960s. Instead of accepting humiliating treatment, the bar patrons fought back this time. Although Stonewall did not mark the origin of gay liberation, it played a tremendous role in gay culture and nightlife. The Stonewall protests highly changed the face of nightlife and triggered gay liberation on the dance floor. Because all the great clubs that followed could focus on gay crowds and let guys dance together. The event didn’t change the freedom of these community drastically in public yet, but this liberation shifted towards underground nightlife.<br><br>One year earlier, in 1968, Steve Osrow founded The Continental Baths, a gay bathhouse in New York. It acted both as a hedonistic playground and a community centre for the queer community. The police raided the bathhouse over two hundred times. The club collected over 250,00 signatures for a petition to change New York City’s outdated laws. That resulted in the repeal of the laws and marked a victory in gay liberation.  Two gay African-American men, Frankie Knuckles and Larry Levan first visited the club in 1973 and developed their DJ skills here. (Gentile, 2016).<br><br>David Mancuso held his first private house parties at his loft in 1970, not too long after the Stonewall riots. The Loft was one of the first dance floors where gay men could safely come together in a racially, economically and sexually mixed crowd. David’s vision was to offer his guests a way to break free from the violence and oppression of reality. (Brewster &amp; Broughton, 2006) Dancers partied under sound vibrations from one of the best sound systems. David fine-tuned the sound system throughout the night. The place was not stated as an official club, for example, alcohol was not being sold. This meant that closing times didn’t exist and the parties stretched at least from midnight until the afternoon. The Loft became an influential example for all the clubs that followed. (Lawrence, 2007) Around the same time, Seymour and Shelley took over the discotheque called ‘The Sanctuary’. They baptised an old German Baptist church into the first nightclub that welcomed gay dancers in a public venue.<br><br>Nicky Siano, a Loft regular, set up his own venue in 1973, inspired by the Loft called the Gallery. According to Mancuso, no other place came as close to the Loft as the Gallery. People began their weekends at the Gallery and ended them at the Loft. the ones who did not get into the Loft, went to the Gallery. Around 1977, Both Larry Levan’s and Frankie Knuckles’ popularity exploded during their DJ residencies at the Gallery. Before this, they both worked at the club. Knuckles DJ career took even bigger steps when he became a resident DJ at Paradise Garage. A new club between 1977 and 1987 in an underground garage. <br>‍<br>Together with a massive devoted following of black and Latino members of the queer community, Paradise Garage influenced dance music and culture. The influence spread both nationally and internationally, it can be seen as  the birthplace of the modern nightclub. This is where disco music transitioned into house music, under guidance by one of worlds greatest mixers, Larry Levan. (Lee &amp; Reynolds, 2000)</div>

    <div id="w-node-bb9011763f6e-e24ba3d1" class="text-block-copy">The disco time also revealed a less inclusive side. A lot of financially hurt queer people, especially black and Latino were excluded. The costs of disco culture, the lifting door fees and pricey drinks excluded certain people. Within gay disco, the inclusive constantly competed with the exclusive. Some private clubs could exclude woman legally and continued as men-only clubs. <br>‍<br>Without the history of disco and its ‘safer spaces’, long before this term entered the mainstream, it seems impossible to see people dance on a pounding four-four kick drum pattern. The name of this beat comes from the drum machine, a so-called four-to-the-floor beat machine. With the arrival of this machine and cheap synthesisers, the mid-seventies soul records inspired disco to change the groove from funky to martial. Disco producers, like Giorgio Moroder, Jean-Marc Cerrone, Patrick Cowley, and Bobby Orlando took a new direction with these machines.</div>

    <div id="w-node-8cd44da651f6-e24ba3d1" class="text-block-copy">While they invited Larry Levan as Paradise Garage’s resident in New York, Frankie Knuckles got invited to become the resident DJ at a new club called the Warehouse in Chicago. From there on, the connection between the dance scenes of New York and Chicago started. (Complex, 2018) In 1976, Robert Williams started the Warehouse, a private queer nightclub in Chicago, Illinois. The origin of Chicago house is often traced back to this club. Knuckles took the leadership and stood behind the turntables for eight to ten hours. After the door price went sky-high, Knuckles left the place. (J. Summer, 2018) When Knuckles left the Warehouse in 1983, founder Robert Williams renamed the place Muzic Box. He invited Ron Hardy to become the new resident DJ. Hardy was one of the people that turned disco into house. The Warehouse was a gay club while the Muzic Box became a more mixed crowd, with heterosexuals and more woman. Although Frankie played more Black disco tracks, Hardy worked the EQ and played intensely at high speeds. It was an out-of-control underground club where people freaked out on the music and drugs. Hardy pushed house forward. (A. Thomas, 2015)<br> <br>According to Luis-Manuel Garcia, house tracks produced in Chicago became highly popular in Britain and developed towards a harder style called ‘acid house’. When crossing the Atlantic back to Chicago, the transformed version of house music became primarily a white, middle-class, heterosexual phenomenon. (Manuel Garcia, 2011) This acid house had exploded in Britain and became the soundtrack of the second Summer of Love in 1988. Ecstasy culture started under the motto of loud music, drugs and all night dancing. (Collin &amp; Godfrey, 1998)</div>
